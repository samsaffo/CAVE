Instructions
1. Unity
To run the CAVE simulator correctly, use the caveTestScene, and ensure it is built together with the MainMenu scene.
The simulator utilizes four cameras, each rendered to a specific display to represent different sides of the CAVE system:
* Display 1: Left wall of the CAVE

* Display 2: Front wall of the CAVE

* Display 3: Floor of the CAVE

* Display 4: Right wall of the CAVE

Camera Location
All four cameras are located within the trolley object in the scene hierarchy:
StorageYards -> StorageYards(1) -> crane-pivot(1) -> Granty Crane(1)


Multiple Display Support in Unity
By default, Unity does not enable multiple displays. To support this feature, a custom script called Enable_multiple_display.cs has been included in the project. This script activates and manages rendering across all four displays.


   2. CAVE
Display Setup and Connection
To connect your PC to the CAVE system, use an app called Spacedesk, which is already installed on three of the projectors (the black ones). These three projectors will be used to display the left, bottom, and right walls of the CAVE. The order of these displays does not matter.
For the front display, use the white projector, which should be connected directly to your PC via HDMI.
All projectors can be calibrated—allowing you to adjust screen size, position, and alignment as needed.
Display Order
The way it works is that the first projector connected to your PC will be assigned to Display 1, the second to Display 2, and so on. Make sure to connect the displays in the intended order and verify their assignments in Unity or your system display settings.
Running the CAVE
To run the CAVE system:
   1. Ensure both the MainMenu and caveTestScene are included in your build.

   2. Connect the projectors to your PC (via Spacedesk or HDMI).

   3. Launch the build and confirm that each display is rendering the correct CAVE wall (left, front, bottom, right).
